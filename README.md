#  Task Management Project

This project is a **Task Management API** built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, using **SQLite** as the database. It features **user authentication** and **role-based authorization** implemented with **JWT** (JSON Web Token). The entire project is built **without using any ORM**, and all database operations are done through raw SQL queries.

## Default Users

When the server is run, two default users are created:

1. **Admin User**
   - **Email**: `admin@gmail.com`
   - **Password**: `admin@123`
   - Role: Admin

2. **Regular User**
   - **Email**: `user@gmail.com`
   - **Password**: `user@123`
   - Role: User

You can perform all the tasks with these two users and check the responses for different roles (admin and user).

## Postman Collection

A Postman collection is attached that contains all the requests for both user and task functionalities. You can import this collection to Postman and use it to test the API endpoints and their responses.
